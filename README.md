## so... what does it even do?
On it's own, not very much. This client side mod uses mixins to tell minecraft to stop hardcoding texture bounds for GUIs.

Without much extra work, resource pack creators can finally use the bottom and right empty space of a texture file! With a little extra work, resource pack creators can offset the start of a GUI to be able to add extra stuff to the top and left sides of an inventory!

## Potential Conflicts
I have not tested any conflicts, but this mod could hypothetically conflict with any mod that tries to change the way minecraft does GUI textures. If you find a mod that conflicts, or even a mod that looks like it would conflict but doesnt, please reach out and I can put it on a list within this section.
